# Todo List Application

This is a simple **React-based Todo List Application** that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can **add**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks, with the state being persisted in the browser using **localStorage**.

## Features

- **Add new tasks**: Users can input a new task to be added to the todo list.
- **Edit tasks**: Tasks can be edited directly from the list.
- **Delete tasks**: Users can remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Persistent storage**: All tasks are saved in localStorage, meaning they will remain even after the page is refreshed.
- **Responsive design**: The app is responsive and works well across different screen sizes.

## Demo

Insert a link to a live demo (if applicable).

- All tasks are stored in the browser’s localStorage, so they will remain after refreshing the page.

## Code Structure

### `App.jsx`

The root component of the app. Manages the state of the todo list and handles adding, deleting, and editing tasks.

- **State Management**:
  - `todos`: Array that stores the list of tasks.
  - `todoValue`: Stores the current input value.
  
- **Functions**:
  - `handleAddTodos`: Adds a new task to the list.
  - `handleDeleteTodo`: Removes a task from the list based on its index.
  - `handleEditTodo`: Prompts the user to edit a task and updates the list accordingly.

### `TodoInput.jsx`

A functional component responsible for rendering the input field and Add button for new tasks.

- **Props**:
  - `todoValue`: The current input value for the new todo.
  - `setTodoValue`: Updates the input value.
  - `handleAddTodos`: Function to add a new task to the list.

### `TodoList.jsx`

Renders the list of tasks by mapping through the `todos` array and rendering individual `TodoCards` components.

- **Props**:
  - `todos`: The array of tasks.
  - `handleDeleteTodo`: Function to delete a task.
  - `handleEditTodo`: Function to edit a task.

### `TodoCards.jsx`

Displays individual todo items with edit and delete buttons.

- **Props**:
  - `children`: The task (todo) text passed from `TodoList`.
  - `handleDeleteTodo`: Function to delete the task.
  - `handleEditTodo`: Function to edit the task.
  - `index`: The index of the current task.

### Styling

- Basic styling is applied using CSS, and you can customize the appearance by modifying the styles in the `.css` files.
- FontAwesome is used for displaying icons.

### LocalStorage

- Todos are stored in `localStorage` so that they persist across page reloads. The state is updated in `localStorage` every time a task is added, edited, or deleted.
